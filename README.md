## C4 Model Documentation

This repository contains documentation for the software architecture using the C4 model. You can find the documentation in the [docs/c4-model](./docs/c4-model) directory.

The C4 model is a lightweight approach to documenting software architecture. It consists of a set of diagrams that describe the system at different levels of detail:

- **System Context:** Shows the system in its environment with its users and the other systems it interacts with.
- **Container:** Zooms into the system boundary to show the high-level containers.
- **Component:** Zooms into an individual container to show the components inside it.
- **Code:** Zooms into an individual component to show the code-level implementation details.
